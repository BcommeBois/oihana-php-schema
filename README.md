Oihana PHP - Schema library

The Oihana schema library is based on the Schema.org vocabulary.

The schema.org ontology can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. 
These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. As of 2024, over 45 million web domains markup their web pages with over 450 billion Schema.org objects. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences.
